# Team Directives

Lightweight conventions the team has settled on. These are **positive rules** — "always X" / "prefer Y over Z" — that don't rise to the level of an ADR but are too important to forget between sessions.

**How this differs from `gotchas.md`:** Gotchas document failure modes and anti-patterns (defensive). Directives document agreed conventions and standards (prescriptive). Gotchas say "don't touch the stove." Directives say "we cook with gas, not electric."

**How this differs from ADRs:** ADRs document significant architectural decisions with context, alternatives, and consequences. Directives are small, low-ceremony rules that accumulate organically. If a directive grows complex enough to need "Alternatives Considered," promote it to an ADR.

## How to Add Directives

Any agent can add a directive to their section during normal work. The format is:

```
- **Directive name.** One-sentence rule. _Why:_ brief rationale.
```

Add directives when:
- The team settles on a convention during code review
- Sato discovers a pattern that should be consistent across the codebase
- Tara establishes a testing convention
- Archie makes a small structural decision that doesn't warrant an ADR
- The human explicitly states a preference

## Code Style (Sato)

<!-- Sato: add coding conventions here as you establish them.
     Examples: "Always use single quotes", "Prefer composition over inheritance", "API responses use camelCase", "Error messages include the failing value" -->

## Testing Conventions (Tara)

<!-- Tara: add testing conventions here as you establish them.
     Examples: "Integration tests hit the real database, never mocks", "Test names follow given_when_then format", "Fixtures go in tests/fixtures/, never inline" -->

## API & Interface Conventions (Archie)

<!-- Archie: add API design conventions here.
     Examples: "All CLI commands support --json output", "Config files use TOML, not YAML", "Public functions have docstrings, private don't" -->

## Documentation Conventions (Diego)

- **Don't hard-wrap Markdown prose.** Write one logical line per paragraph and let the editor and renderer soft-wrap it; never insert manual newlines to hit a column width. Lists, tables, code fences, and frontmatter keep their own line structure. _Why:_ hard wraps make diffs lie — a three-word edit reflows the whole paragraph, so `git blame` and PR diffs show lines changed that weren't. Soft-wrapped prose diffs at the sentence, not the column.

<!-- Diego: add documentation conventions here.
     Examples: "README quick-start must work in under 5 minutes", "Changelog entries use past tense", "API docs include a curl example for every endpoint" -->

## Security Conventions (Pierrot)

- **Age external dependencies before adopting them.** A newly added or upgraded direct dependency must be a version at least 3 days old, unless the human overrides (log the reason in `dependency-decisions.md`); prefer native enforcement (pnpm/Bun `minimumReleaseAge`). _Why:_ most compromised releases are caught and yanked within days — a cooldown means you're rarely first to install a poisoned one. Full reasoning, the CVE-override rule, and the window tiers: ADR-0010.
- **Vet and pin MCP servers like any other dependency.** Before adding an MCP server, review who publishes it and what access it grants (files, network, credentials); pin its version; keep approved servers on an allowlist rather than wiring in open-ended ones; and watch for rug-pulls — a trusted server changing behavior or tool schemas after you've adopted it. _Why:_ an MCP server is unvetted third-party code that hands your agent new powers, and it's a fast-growing, largely-unpinned tool-supply surface — cheap to gate now, expensive to retrofit after an incident.

<!-- Pierrot: add security conventions here.
     Examples: "Never log PII, even at debug level", "All user input validated at the boundary", "Secrets come from env vars, never config files" -->

## DevOps & Infrastructure (Ines)

- **Pin CI actions to immutable commit SHAs, not tags.** Reference every third-party GitHub Action (or equivalent CI plugin) by its full-length commit SHA with the human-readable version in a trailing comment (`uses: actions/checkout@<40-char-sha> # v4`), never by a mutable tag or branch. Keep the lockfile committed and matching the manifest. _Why:_ a tag like `v4` can be silently repointed by whoever controls the action, swapping in code you never reviewed — a live supply-chain vector — whereas a SHA can't move under you, and a committed lockfile makes any dependency change visible in the diff instead of resolving invisibly at build time.

<!-- Ines: add infra conventions here.
     Examples: "CI must pass before merge, no exceptions", "Docker images use distroless base", "All env vars documented in .env.example" -->

## Design & UX (Dani)

- **Team hero sprites live as `site/src/assets/team/<slug>.webp`.** Generated externally per the team hero-sprite art bible, exported to WebP at display sizes, and dropped into the assets folder; `TeamGrid.astro` renders a placeholder until each one lands. _Why:_ keeps generated binaries out of the build path and the page green before the art exists. (Convention, not an ADR — no alternatives analysis needed.)
- **Accent text on a fixed-dark panel must clear WCAG AA (4.5:1).** Lift dark brand accents with `color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent), white 42%)` rather than hand-picking lighter hexes. _Why:_ keeps the palette anchored to the bible while staying legible.

<!-- Dani: add more design conventions here.
     Examples: "All interactive elements have focus indicators", "Color is never the only differentiator" -->
