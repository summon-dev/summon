// briefed to "write the file on turn 1 and end it with a sentinel" wrote
// `PIERROT-COMPLETE: 0 findings, 0 critical` above a body reading
// `Status: IN PROGRESS`, then ran out of turns. The coordinator's gate compares
// the declared count against the findings present — 0 matched 0 — so it passed.

### Finding 1 — the separator class is too narrow
